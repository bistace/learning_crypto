# Learning cryptography

This repository contains my notes and code examples as I work through various books and tutorials on cryptography fundamentals.
The goal is to build up a strong foundation in modern applied cryptography concepts and techniques for software developers. I want to learn both the theory and practical implementation.
All implementations are the solution I came up with and are, therefore, probably not the most optimal solution. If you have some ideas for improvement, please open up an issue or submit a PR!

# Currently implemented
  - Caesar cipher encryption and decryption
  - Caesar cipher bruteforce decryption using a list of the most common english words
